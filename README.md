## Description

This weather dashboard gives you a city's present day weather information: temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. This also gives you the forecast for the upcoming 5 days so that you can organize your plans for the week with the weather in mind.

## Usage

In the search bar, enter the name of a city and click search. You will be presented with that city's weather data for the day and a 5 day forecast to the right.
Each search records that city's name below the search bar. Pressing these new buttons will display the previously searched city's weather information.
